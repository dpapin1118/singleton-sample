# singleton-sample
Attempt to implement a singleton without cloning in Rust


Creates a "SERVICES" object where to place all your services's data structure.

As an example, stores a Params structure that represents the input parameters of a program. 

Call the service in various places and read the Params' values back.

### Note :

It seems hard to put something like an Option<> in the Params structure.
